# detect-mobile-screen-on-or-off

Mobile pictures collected from internet and youtube videos and then data augmentation techniques used to increase the training sample for model development.

Considered 151 sample datasets with 3 channel for mobile phone's screen on/off detection ML model development.  Every pictures augmented 6 times to increase the training samples using keras's ImageDataGenerator function. After image data augmetation total training sample used for model developed was about 900+.

Model Accuracy: 94%
